## Summary
In this hackathon we are presented with the problem of detecting potholes within a set of street images captured in accident-prone cities for the government of Sihao. The solution will assist with identifying street potholes automatically so they can be handled quickly and reduce the number of accidents caused by them.

In this Computer Vision problem, various image processing and augmentation techniques are applied to a limited set of training images to build a Fast Region-Based Convolution Neural Network (Fast R-CNN) in PyTorch and identify pothole objects and generate respective bounding boxes. The final settled upon solution resulted in a 0.3969370931 confidence score on the private competitin test set and a 9th place position.
